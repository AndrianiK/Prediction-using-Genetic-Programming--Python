## Neural and Evolutionary Learning Project
#### Overview 
The primary objective of this project is to compare and discuss the behaviour, performance, and application of four models:
- Genetic Programming (GP)
- Geometric Semantic Geometric Programming (GSGP)
- Neural Networks with backpropagation (NN)
- NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)


*The framework of the Genetic Programming models are based on:*
