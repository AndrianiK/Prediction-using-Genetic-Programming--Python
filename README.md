## Neural and Evolutionary Learning Project
### Guidance / Instructions
Download all files in repository! <br>
Leave untouched the gpol library and the csv files!<br>
If needed, run only the notebooks of EDA (1), the model implementations (2), and the final evaluation (3).
<br>

The report presents detailed methodology, explanations and results.

### Overview 
The primary objective of this project is to compare and discuss the behaviour, performance, and application of four models:
- Genetic Programming (GP)
- Geometric Semantic Geometric Programming (GSGP)
- Neural Networks with backpropagation (NN)
- NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)



*The framework of the Genetic Programming models are based on:*
